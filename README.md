# slg_pipe

This is a collection of shell scripts written by Eric Anderson
to ease the task of running genetic data through a variety of 
analyses.  It was written around 2010 and was used internally.

Anyone is welcome to use this, though I can't promise that I will
be helpful trying to work through any bugs.  We are currently
using it on a Mac running Mavericks.  It includes some binaries
for Mac, and the code is not available in this repository, so
don't plan on using it on a different platform.
